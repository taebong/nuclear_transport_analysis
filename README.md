# nuclear_transport_analysis
key analysis codes used for quantitative measurement of nuclear transport rates in cells using optogenetic nuclear transport probes (e.g. LEXY &amp; LINuS)

batch_workflow.sh shows an example of how you could run the codes in sequence to analyze time-lapse microscopy data and quantify nuclear transport rates of individual cells.
